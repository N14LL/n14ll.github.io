Its a Personal Homepage... although I usually host my projects on specific URLs/Links behind the main 'front' of my website, usually its set up as the 404 redirect too!

If you want to use the code - read the license terms (although honestly, its a simple page - you can go ahead and copy any little css/html tricks or actions you like the look of!)
